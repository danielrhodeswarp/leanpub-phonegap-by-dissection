## What is it?

Sources for "PhoneGap by Dissection" free book as on Leanpub.com. [https://leanpub.com/phonegapbydissection]
Which is a step-by-step tutorial for PhoneGap beginners. Follow this tutorial to build a complete app from scratch. You should know a little bit about JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The tutorial assumes nothing and is very hand-holdy. It includes a lot of screenshots. Try it!

## What's good about it?

* The price is right
* Some people might like it (?)
* Pretty picture on front cover

## What's bad about it?

* A year out of date already. Covers PhoneGap v3.3.0 when the latest (at time of writing) is v4.0.0
* Some bits missing
* Some bits unclear
* Doesn't properly mention screen DPI and font size etc
* The typographic distinction between code and file/folder (that the original at https://github.com/danielrhodeswarp/phonegap-by-dissection had) has been lost
* Japanese characters don't seem to survive Leanpub.com's XSLT / LaTeX fandanglery :-(
* Chapter 14 is listed and present, but doesn't come out at the Leanpub end ??
