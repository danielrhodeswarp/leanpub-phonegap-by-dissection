# Launcher icon {#chapter-11}

Now we move on to our launcher icon. We are provided with a default one which is like
a robot cube thing. Let's replace this with one more relevant for Japxlate. Let's
have one with our "J".
We simply replace the icon.png files in the various drawable folders.
The size of each existing icon.png will tell you the required icon
size for that density.

[http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html) is a useful design and technical reference.

Note that you *might*, in order for the icon to update on deploy to the device, need to do a Project --> Clean in Eclipse IDE.

I> The PhoneGap / Cordova documentation for v3.3.0 now has a useful summary section on [Icons and Splash Screens](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.3.0/config_ref_images.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens).
