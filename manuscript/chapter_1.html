        <p>To keep things small and simple we'll focus solely on developing on <strong>Linux</strong> for an app that we'll make for
<strong>Android</strong>. Though one huge benefit of PhoneGap is that you can package the same(ish) code into a working app
for many different mobile platforms. We also won't be using any third-party JavaScript or CSS libraries, though
these will be useful to you going forward with your app development. What you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Linux desktop box</li>
<li>PhoneGap (which requires NodeJS) on the above box - at time of writing this tutorial I was using version 3.1.0.
Don't worry, we'll install this in the <a href="#getting_started">Getting started</a> chapter</li>
<li>As many Android devices as you can get your hands on! At least one</li>
<li>Google's "Android Developer Tools" bundle - or at least Eclipse with the Android plugins. 
Again we'll cover this in the <a href="#getting_started">Getting started</a> chapter</li>
<li>At least a lower-intermediate knowledge of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS</li>
<li>To not be terrified of the Linux command line!</li>
</ul>
