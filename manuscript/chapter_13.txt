[NOTETOSELF this is going to be a wrapping up chat. talk about the app's pros and cons, PhoneGap
pros and cons. And talk about what they need to do and research going forward with their app development. strongly recommend
libraries like Sencha Touch, jQuery Mobile and iScroll especially as doing scrolling from scratch took 
me more than 50% of total development time which is ridiculous!]
