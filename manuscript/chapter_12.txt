# Submitting to Google Play {#chapter-12}

[NOTETOSELF expand on this section]

This topic deserves - and has - whole books and tutorials dedicated to it. [NOTETOSELF some links would be nice]
We'll cover it in a whistle-stop fashion. To publish your app on the Play Store, follow these steps:

1. Open `PROJECTROOT/AndroidManifest.xml` and change `android:debuggable="true"` to `android:debuggable="false"`
2. In Eclipse IDE, right-click on the Project and select Android Tools --> Export Signed Application Package
3. Follow the steps (choosing "create new keystore") and be sure to save the keystore file and password, and the alias password, in your favourite secure place for future reference
4. The final step creates an .apk file in the location you specify. This is what we will upload to google.
5. You will need to attach an Android Developer account to an already existing vanilla Google account.
      Do this by logging into Google with your vanilla account first, then signing up as an Android developer at
      [https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup).
6. **You'll need a credit or debit card handy as there is a one-off registration fee of $25.**
7. Upload the .apk file to your shiny new Developer account, set the title, description and screenshots
      (you also need a 512px x 512px hi-res icon) and Bob's your uncle!
