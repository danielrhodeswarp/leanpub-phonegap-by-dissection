<h2 id="what_is_phonegap">What is PhoneGap?</h2> 

<p>PhoneGap is a way to make apps for mobile devices using standard website frontend technologies.
Namely HTML5, JavaScript
and CSS. PhoneGap is free and open source. PhoneGap apps aren't true or <em>native</em> apps, but rather they are apps that open up a "WebView"
on you mobile device - 
essentially a web browser in fullscreen mode without title bars or bezels - running your
frontend code. It's not a million miles away from a desktop browser running in fullscreen
mode (usually accessed by pressing F11). Implemented well, this non-nativeness isn't necessarily a bad thing.

<strong>PhoneGap versus Cordova</strong>
<p>You've probably come across the term "Cordova" in your research for PhoneGap.
PhoneGap and Cordova are very closely related, and so it's worth explaining the difference.
There's a lot of back-story here which I'll skip, but in a nutshell:</p>

<p><strong>PhoneGap</strong> is a software product by Adobe Systems Inc. It is a branded and
maintained distribution of:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a></strong>, which is a free and open source project maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).</p>

<p>At the time of writing, PhoneGap adds a <em>cloud build</em> service to basic Cordova. This changes the command line for PhoneGap (versus Cordova) somewhat, though you should be able to - in theory - follow this tutorial using plain vanilla Cordova instead of PhoneGap.
I also noticed, annoyingly, that a lot of PhoneGap documentation simply points to Cordova documentation which can mean that the command line syntax is wrong.</p>
