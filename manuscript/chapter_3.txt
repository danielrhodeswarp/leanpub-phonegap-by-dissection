# What is PhoneGap {#chapter-3}

PhoneGap is a way to make apps for mobile devices using standard website frontend technologies.
Namely HTML5, JavaScript
and CSS. PhoneGap is free and open source. PhoneGap apps aren't true or *native* apps, but rather they are apps that open up a "WebView"
on you mobile device - 
essentially a web browser in fullscreen mode without title bars or bezels - running your
frontend code. It's not a million miles away from a desktop browser running in fullscreen
mode (usually accessed by pressing F11). Implemented well, this non-nativeness isn't necessarily a bad thing.

A> ## PhoneGap versus Cordova
A>
A> You've probably come across the term "Cordova" in your research for PhoneGap.
A> PhoneGap and Cordova are very closely related, and so it's worth explaining the difference.
A> There's a lot of back-story here which I'll skip, but in a nutshell:
A>
A> **PhoneGap** is a software product by Adobe Systems Inc. It is a branded and
A> maintained distribution of:
A>
A> [**Cordova**](http://cordova.apache.org/), which is a free and open source project maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
A>
A> At the time of writing, PhoneGap adds a *cloud build* service to basic Cordova. This changes the command line for PhoneGap (versus Cordova) somewhat, though you
A> should be able to - in theory - follow this tutorial using plain vanilla Cordova instead of PhoneGap.
A> I also noticed, annoyingly, that a lot of PhoneGap documentation simply points to Cordova documentation which can mean that the command line syntax is wrong.
