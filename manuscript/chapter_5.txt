# First things first: The layout {#chapter-5}

Japxlate is going to have a single screen or "intent". It won't jump out to, for example, your phone's
camera intent or "share to" list. The single screen is going to have three tab options - Search, Discover and Write.
We want the tab navigation and current tab content to all fit on the device display without scrolling.
OK, the PhoneGap Hello World app we just looked at is a good start, but let's see what tweaks we can do.

The Japxlate app is a spinoff of the [@japxlate](https://twitter.com/japxlate) Twitter channel, so let's look at that to get some design
ideas:

![Figure 4. The @japxlate Twitter channel](images/fig_40.png)

OK, so we've got a greyish background. The logo is a red 'J' on a white background. The red is our signature red
and is actually #990000. The red 'J' on a white background is going to be a good launcher icon for our app which we'll talk about in a later chapter.

Right, so we need three tabs and we have some colour ideas. Here's a quick wireframe:

![Figure 5. Quick wireframe of the Japxlate app layout](images/fig_50.png)

Let's put our tabs at the top so they're out of the way of our device's core Android buttons (back, home, menu / special).
Let's have a little footer and see if we need that.
The footer and header have grey backgrounds. The tab content area is bog-standard black text on a white background.
When a tab is tapped, the header and footer will stay the same (though possibly with some kind of current tab
highlight) but the content area will load the appropriate content for that tab.

HTML5 gives us `<header>` and `<footer>` elements, so let's try those. Change the `<body>` in `index.html` to look like:

{lang="html"}
~~~~~~~~
<body>
    <header>
        header
    </header>
    <div class="japxlate_app">    <!--note we've changed the class name-->
        content area
    </div>
    <footer>
        footer
    </footer>
    <!--<script type="text/javascript" src="phonegap.js"></script>-->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        app.initialize();
    </script>
</body>
~~~~~~~~

Fire this up on your device (or desktop Chrome) and it looks like this:

![Figure 6. Unstyled `<header>` and `<footer>`](images/fig_60.png)

Not quite what we had in mind! The `<header>` and `<footer>` are both 100% wide which is great, but we need to give them positions and heights (with tab content
taking up the remaining space inbetween). Also let's get rid of the PhoneGap background gradient and put our own background
colours in. Also let's take out the forced uppercase. Change the `body` clause in `index.css` to look like this:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
body {
    -webkit-touch-callout: none;                /* prevent callout to copy image, etc when tap to hold */
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;             /* prevent webkit from resizing text to fit */
    -webkit-user-select: none;                  /* prevent copy paste, to allow, change 'none' to 'text' */
    font-family:'HelveticaNeue-Light', 'HelveticaNeue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size:12px;
    height:100%;
    margin:0px;
    padding:0px;
    width:100%;
}
~~~~~~~~

Then add a clause for `header` like this:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
header {
    background-color:#555;  /*medium grey*/
    color:#ccc;             /*slightly greyish white*/
    height:40px;
    line-height:40px;       /*height of a *text* line*/
}
~~~~~~~~

Then add a clause for `footer` like this:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
footer {
    background-color:#555;  /*medium grey*/
    color:#ccc;             /*slightly greyish white*/
    height:20px;
    line-height:20px;
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 7. `<footer>` is too high](images/fig_70.png)

Hmm, the footer isn't at the bottom! Let's position it absolutely and make it flush with the bottom of its parent
(the document body). Add to the `footer` rule so that it looks like:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
footer {
    background-color:#555;  /*medium grey*/
    color:#ccc;             /*slightly greyish white*/
    height:20px;             
    line-height:20px;
    position:absolute;
    bottom:0;
    width:100%;             /*no default width for position:absolute*/
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 8. `<footer>` flush with bottom of document body](images/fig_80.png)

Great! Now let's put our three tabs into the header. We'll do it as an unordered list of links. Make
`<header>` of `index.html` look like this:

{lang="html"}
~~~~~~~~
<header>
    <ul id="tab-bar">
        <li >
            <a href="#search">Search</a>
        </li>
        <li >
            <a href="#discover">Discover</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#write">Write</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</header>
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 9. First attempt at tabs](images/fig_90.png)

Clearly a disaster! We need some styling to line up the list items horizontally in the header.
Add the following three clauses to the CSS file:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
/*entire tab row*/
#tab-bar {
    /*clear any inside and outside gap space*/
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
}

/*each tab*/
#tab-bar li {
    display: inline;    /*prevent each item from newlining*/
    float:left;         /*stack left*/
    width: 33.3333%;    /*have a third of total tab-bar space*/
}

/*tappable link in each tab*/
#tab-bar li a { 
    color: #ccc;
    display: block;         /*make "width-having"*/
    font-weight: bold;
    overflow: hidden;       /*so long link text words get cropped*/
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;  /*remove default link underline*/
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 10. Tabs line up horizontally](images/fig_100.png)

Looking good! But the tabs need a few more things to look more useful. Namely, horizontal dividers,
icons and some kind of current tab highlight.
For the horizontal dividers, let's try giving the second and third tabs a left border. CSS version 2
(the latest version being 3) has a nifty selector where we can say "element type Y only where it follows an
element type X". With this we can target any tab after the first one and apply a left border. Add the
following clause to the CSS:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
/*a border-left for the middle and rightmost tab*/
#tab-bar li + li
{
    border-left:1px solid #aaa;    /*light grey*/
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 11. `<header>` too wide for document body](images/fig_110.png)

Ouch, that's not a good look. What's happened here is that the border has *added* 1px to the total width of the 
second and third tabs. These tabs are now wider than a 3rd of the `<header>` row and so the last tab gets
bumped onto the next line. This is A Very Annoying Thing. One cheesy little workaround for this is to
use a simple background image to simulate the border.
Make a 1 pixel wide by 16 pixel tall image in [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) (or what-have-you) and floodfill with #aaaaaa which
is a very light grey. Export to a PNG image in `assests/www/img` called `aaaaaa_16_v.png`.
Then change the previously added CSS clause to look like this:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
/*simulate a border-left for the middle and rightmost tab*/
#tab-bar li + li
{
    background-image:url(../img/aaaaaa_16_v.png);
    background-repeat:repeat-y;
    background-position:left;
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 12. `<header>` fits nicely](images/fig_120.png)

Pretty good! OK, we'll do the icons next. We want each tab to have a little icon on it. There are millions of icon sets floating around these days. They tend to be one of three types:

* Always free
* Free only for personal use (else you should pay)
* Always paid-for

There's also new school *flat* icons versus traditional deep icons. Design memes come and go but we'll go with
something a little flat. We'll use these rather nice ones which are royalty-free, free for personal and commercial use:

[http://www.graphicsfuel.com/2013/04/20-flat-icons-psd](http://www.graphicsfuel.com/2013/04/20-flat-icons-psd)

Note that these icons are in PNG format which is a raster format. Raster icons are easy to use, but can only be
shrunk or enlarged by extracting or guessing information (respectively). This means they only really look good
at their *native* size which means that, depending on the pixel density of the device display, they might be too tiny
and hard to make out or really massive and Legoish. But we'll use them for simplicity.

One alternative would be to use a vector format - such as SVG - for the icons which stores the image such that
it can be scaled up or down without losing information.
Another new trend is to have the browser load something called an icon font. This is like a normal font but where
each character is an icon (remember Wingdings?!). This has the advantage that the icons are sizeable just like
any other text. Also they can be bolded or italicised. **But** they can only be of one colour.

Go ahead and put all of the PNG icons in `assets/www/img` (though we won't use all of them).
Let's reference some of these icons in our tab markup, change `<header>` in `index.html`
to look like this:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
<header>
    <ul id="tab-bar">
        <li>
            <a href="#search"><img src="img/search.png"> Search</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#discover"><img src="img/chat-bubble.png"> Discover</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#write"><img src="img/file.png"> Write</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</header>
~~~~~~~~

Note the space after the image and before the link text. Running this gives:

![Figure 13. Icons we sourced are way too big](images/fig_130.png)

Woah, those icons are pretty big eh? The icons are a mix of square, tall or wide, but they all have a biggest
side of about 128 pixels. That's clearly way too big for us here. Let's use GIMP to resize `search.png`,
`chat-bubble.png` and `file.png` to have a biggest side of 16px - the same as our app font size (in `index.css`) [NOTETOSELF double check this].
So go ahead and make those changes and overwrite the original icon files. While you're at it, do the same
for `paste.png` because we'll be using that later on. (Feel free to trash the other icon files from
`assets/www/img` as we won't be needing them in this little app.) Those scalable icon formats are looking real
attractive now huh?

After changing the icon sizes, it looks like this:

![Figure 14. Icons at correct size](images/fig_140.png)

Not bad at all. But hmmmm, don't you think the icons look a little out of whack? Like they're slightly
higher than the line of text? We can remedy this by adding to the CSS:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
a img {
    vertical-align:middle;    /*make more sensible relative to text baseline*/
}
~~~~~~~~

(Yes, we could do these icons as CSS background images but what the heck.) That's better.
We restrict this only to images in `<a>`'s so we don't screw up any other images we might
have in the markup.

All we need now is a highlight for the currently selected tab, and while we're at it we should
choose our default tab that we want to be displayed first on app load. Let's plump for the
Search tab. Add a class name of "current" to the Search tab thus:

{lang="html"}
~~~~~~~~
<ul id="tab-bar">
    <li class="current">
        <a href="#search"><img src="img/search.png"> Search</a>
    </li>
    .
    .
</ul>
~~~~~~~~

Then, in the CSS, modify `#tab-bar li{}` and add `#tab-bar li.current{}` thus:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
/*each tab*/
#tab-bar li {
    display: inline;
    float:left;
    width: 33.3333%;
    border-bottom:3px solid #555;   /*same bg as header*/
}

/*current tab*/
#tab-bar li.current {
    border-bottom:3px solid #990000;    /*signature red*/
}
~~~~~~~~

We simply add a bottom border, in our signature red, to any tab bar list item that has a class of "current". 
We also add a border of the same size but using the header's background colour to *non* current tabs.
This keeps everything looking flush horizontally. Later on (soon actually!) we will use JavaScript
to detect tap events on the tabs and change the current tab. Running what you have so far looks like:

![Figure 15. Current tab highlight](images/fig_150.png)

Pretty good! Only two little things are bugging us now. The content area text starts a little too
close to the tab bar, and, thinking about it this app doesn't really need a footer at all!
Change the HTML footer to simply look like this:

{lang="html"}
~~~~~~~~
<footer></footer>
~~~~~~~~

Then add `.japxlate_app{}` to the CSS and also change the height of `footer{}` thus:

{lang="css"}
~~~~~~~~
.japxlate_app {
    padding-top:1em;        /*move content away from tab bar*/
}

footer {
    background-color:#555;
    color:#ccc;
    height:2px;             /*down to 2px from 20px*/          
    line-height:20px;       /*no longer meaningful...*/
    position:absolute;
    bottom:0;
    width:100%;
}
~~~~~~~~

Running this looks like:

![Figure 16. Final app layout](images/fig_160.png)

Which we'll stick with for the rest of the tutorial - and app! We have a 2px footer which is
a bit gimmicky, but will help us a bit with scroll debugging a bit later on. The tab content text is now
one newline(ish) down from the tab bar.

A> ## To fullscreen or not?
A>
A> You might have noticed by now that the default PhoneGap app, and our own app's layout that we've just finished,
A> fill the *entire* screen of the device. Even the Android status bar (which shows the time, battery charge and
A> signal strength etc) is obliterated.
A> 
A> Game apps tend to fill the entire screen, but almost every utility app out there leaves the status bar.
A> The good news is that we can get the status bar back quite easily by opening `PROJECTROOT/platforms/android/res/xml/config.xml`
A> and changing:
A>
A> {lang="xml"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> <preference name="fullscreen" value="true" />
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>
A> to
A> 
A> {lang="xml"}
A> ~~~~~~~~
A> <preference name="fullscreen" value="false" />
A> ~~~~~~~~
A>
A> and then re-running the app.
A> 
A> You can choose which style you like and the rest of this tutorial is valid either way.
A> Note that figures showing device screenshots *won't* have the status bar.
