# What you'll need {#chapter-2}
        
To keep things small and simple we'll focus solely on developing on **Linux** for an app that we'll make for
**Android**. Though one huge benefit of PhoneGap is that you can package the same(ish) code into a working app
for many different mobile platforms. We also won't be using any third-party JavaScript or CSS libraries, though
these will be useful to you going forward with your app development. What you'll need:

* A Linux desktop box
* PhoneGap (which requires NodeJS) on the above box - at time of writing this tutorial I was using version 3.1.0.
Don't worry, we'll install this in the [Getting started](#chapter-4) chapter
* As many Android devices as you can get your hands on! At least one
* Google's "Android Developer Tools" bundle - or at least Eclipse with the Android plugins. 
Again we'll cover this in the [Getting started](#chapter-4) chapter
* At least a lower-intermediate knowledge of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS
* To not be terrified of the Linux command line!
